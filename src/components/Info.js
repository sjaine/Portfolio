        Hey there! I'm Yoonsoo <span>(aka Jaine!)</span>, currently studying Interaction Design at Sheridan College. I'm passionate about creating visually appealing products that enhance user convenience, always refining my work until it meets my standards.
        <br />
        <br />
        My interest in visual aesthetics and building my own website inspired me to pursue Interaction Design. Iâ€™ve gained valuable experience in <span>human-centered design</span> and developed the ability to bridge the gap between <span>design and development.</span> <i>(Fun fact: I fully hand-coded my portfolio site as well! Someone asked me, 'Which website did you use to create your portfolio?')</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        As a front-end developer, I focus on turning design into functional code with <span>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React,</span> ensuring a joyful user experience. I'm excited to keep learning and collaborate with more designers as I grow in this field!</div>
